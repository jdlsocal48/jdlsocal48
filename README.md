- 👋 Hi, I’m David
- 👀 I’m interested in helping people in their darkest times and i enjoy structural organization
- I am a self starter and worked in diverse groups and alone with very little supervision.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cyber security and coding

- the companies bottom line.  Root cause analysis, process improvement, and lean manufacturing are very much in line with cybersecurity and that prospect is very exciting for me. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on in cyber security in a company with growth culture.  I am looking forwared in applying what i have learned in my diverse work career and my years in quality engineering.
